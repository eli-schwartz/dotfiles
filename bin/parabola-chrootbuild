# There are two issues with building packages targeted at parabola, and both
# have the same fundamental cause: pkgrel is often ending in ".par1" which
# makepkg does not allow.

# In order to adapt to this, you need a copy of makepkg with this patch:
# https://git.parabola.nu/abslibre.git/tree/libre/pacman/0001-makepkg-Treat-pkgrel-more-similarly-to-pkgver.patch?id=6af3b6469459012f1c71117c45959ff3d836103c

# This is firstly installed into /opt/makepkg-parabola in order to let
# makechrootpkg download sources. Second, it must also be installed as a pacman
# package into a custom build chroot, hence archbuild -r.
